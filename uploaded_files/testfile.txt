In the quiet town of Elmsworth, an old clockmaker named Horace lived above his dusty little shop, Time & Tide. His neighbors thought of him as a harmless recluse, spending his days repairing grandfather clocks and ornate pocket watches for the dwindling number of customers who still cared about such things.

One rainy evening, as Horace wound the hands of an antique brass clock, the mechanism clicked in an unfamiliar way. A hidden compartment popped open, revealing a folded letter dated 1874 and signed only with the initial A. The letter described the location of a “time key” — an object said to unlock a door “when the moon forgets the hour.”

Intrigued, Horace followed the letter’s clues across town, from the ivy-covered library to the abandoned railway station, each stop revealing another cryptic line etched in brass plates hidden in plain sight. As midnight approached, he reached the old lighthouse on the cliff. The moon hung low but strangely dim, as if cloaked in shadow.

Inside, Horace found a narrow staircase spiraling down instead of up. At the bottom, in a room humming with unseen machinery, sat a pedestal holding an intricate silver key. As his hand closed around it, every clock in Elmsworth — from the church tower to the smallest wristwatch — stopped ticking.

The silence was absolute.
